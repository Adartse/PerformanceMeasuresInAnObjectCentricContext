# Defining process performance measures in an object-centric context

This repository includes a set of models of performance measures used in the paper _Defining process performance measures in an object-centric context_, presented at the [1st International Workshop on Data-Driven Business Process Optimization (BPO)](https://bpm2022.uni-muenster.de/workshops/1st-international-workshop-data-driven-business-process-optimization-bpo) of the [BPM 2022 conference](https://bpm2022.uni-muenster.de/). 

The performance measures presented were modeled using an extension of the [PPINOT metamodel](https://www.isa.us.es/ppinot/documentation/ppinot-metamodel/), a metamodel that allows an unambiguous and complete definition of process performance indicators (PPIs). The PPINOT metamodel extension includes a set of features that allow the definition of performance measures in an object-centric context.
